RemoteValues, sample project: customer queuing management
---------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

With DigitalSignage.com and RemoteValues, you can easily integrate a customer queuing managment tool into your business.
This will allow your workers complete control over which number to display, as well as provide your customers with the ability to scan a QR code on the screen and keep monitoring their status in line from their mobile device.
This means that your customers do not have to be confined in a room waiting to be served on, instead they can leave and stay up-to-date on when will they be served on.

We provide the working sample code powered by node.js web server that can run on Windows, Linux or Mac.
The application is organized into 4 modules.

1. server software which manages the current que being served as well as the HTML pages your works and customers will interface with.
2. terminal.html is the user interface your employees will use to manage the que.
3. nowServing.html is the user interface your customers will use to stay updated with their current que position (using QR and mobile phone)

Server installation:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
To launch the server be sure to install node.js as well as the required modules:

<pre>
npm install express@3 (which express server 3.0)
npm install jquery
npm install underscore
</pre>

Launch the server using:

<pre>
node server.js
</pre>

The server by default listens to connection on port 8080

User configuration and interaction
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Next edit terminal.html and nowServing.html and replace 'digitalsignage.com' with your server ip or DNS name.

for example:

<pre>
document.domain = 'digitalsignage.com';
var u = 'http://www.digitalsignage.com:8080/nowServing';
</pre>

<pre>
document.domain = 'digitalsignage.com';
$.ajax({
 url: 'http://www.digitalsignage.com:8080/' + step,
 ...
</pre>

Once the server is up and running you can launch:

http://[YOUR_IP]:8080/remoteValues/nowServing.html
http://[YOUR_IP]:8080/remoteValues/terminal.html

Installation:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

StudioLite can be downloaded directly from GitHub, or (recommended) is to install it through node.js and npm.
With node.js and npm you will be able to easily update to the latest version of StudioLite as well as take advantage of the the built in Express server that is included with StudioLite.

<h4>Option 1 (recommended):</h4>
- Download node.js (all major operating systems supported): http://nodejs.org/
- Install node.js 
- open a terminal (Mac / Linux) or command prompt (windows)
- switch to node.js directory and run: ```npm install studiolite```
- change directory to: ```./node_modules/studiolite``` 
- run the command ```node server.js``` if you wish to use the bundled express server
- you may also host it directly on your own web server if you like, such as apache or IIS
- open browser and point it to ```[YOUR_IP]:8080/_studiolite-dev/studiolite.html```

<h4>Option 2:</h4>
- Download the zip from GitHub
- On your web server (i.e.: apache, IIS) create a root directory and name it: _studiolite-dev
- Unzip all files into _studiolite-dev directory
- open browser and point it to ```[YOUR_IP]/_studiolite-dev/studiolite.html```
- IMPORTANT: make sure _studiolite-dev is in the root of web server

Updates:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you used ```npm install studiolite``` updating is as easy as switching to your node directory and typing ```node update studiolite``` to get the latest release
If you downloaded directly from GitHub, you will need to re-download the zip file and expand over your existing installation.
 
npm registry: https://www.npmjs.org/package/studiolite 

Customization:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Keep in mind the SignageStudio lite as well as its related SDK Pepper are often released with new updates, so you will lose any changes you make to your code if you overwrite it with our release builds.

To overcome this you can follow these guidelines:

1.	Always be sure to override files and not modify the original source file. This is true for both CSS and JavaScript code. Simply load your version of the CSS after ours to apply your latest changes. HTML files can be diffed (see below).
2.	Our code base is modulated and uses 100% object oriented design pattern. This allows you to sub class (aka inherit) from our classes and make your applied changes (use _.extend to mixin).
3.	You can also use pre-processor scripts which replace code segments automatically using directives.
4.	And finally, even while following steps 1-3 you may find that your code is broken due to design changes in the original repository. Thatâ€™s when GitHub comes to the rescue. When your fork the source repository, you can always merge the tree onto your forked project. Use source control diff tool to merge the changes into your code and resolve any conflicts.

With the above steps you can ensure that your source code is fully customizable while still keeping it synchronized with our ongoing development efforts.
And if you built something wonderful, just send us a pull request so we check it out. 
If we like what you did we we will merge it into our code base, so you will always receive it when you fetch our changes.

If you are not a developer you can hire professional, inexpensive help from sites like oDesk and Freelancer.
Just post you are looking for a JavaScript, jQuery, Backbone experienced developer.
